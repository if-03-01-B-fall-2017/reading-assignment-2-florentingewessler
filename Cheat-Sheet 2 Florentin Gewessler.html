			<h3> Void Elements</h3>
			<section>
				A void element is any element that can not, by definition, have any content in between the start and end tags, but the only type of data that void elements are allowed to have are attributes. Some examples of void elements that you are probably already familiar with include the img (image), br (break), hr (horizontal rule), and meta tags.

		<h2>CSS</h2>
		
			<h3> Name the components of a css rule proberly</h3>
			<section>
				The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
				The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
				Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>
				A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Use combinators probably</h3>
			<section>
				A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.<br>
				<br>
				There are four different combinators in CSS3:<br>
				<br>
				descendant selector (space)<br>
				child selector (>)<br>
				adjacent sibling selector (+)<br>
				general sibling selector (~)b´<br>

			</section>
			
			<h3>Pseudo classes for the a element </h3>
			<section>

				<br>

				<br>

			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font style normal and italic</h3>
			<section>
				f people are on your website, they’re probably either skimming quickly, looking for something, or they’ve found what they’re looking for and want to read it as easily as possible. Either way, keeping text readable will help them achieve their goal.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font sizes</h3>
			<section>
				The CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.<br>
			</section>
			
			<h3>Declarations for font weights</h3>
			<section>
				When using @font-face to embed a typeface that has several weights and styles, your CSS can become a bit of a mess unless you define those weights and styles in the @font-face declarations. Unfortunately some tutorials and font embedding services do not do this.<br>
